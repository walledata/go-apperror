# go-apperror

A Go error model for applications that follow a ports-and-adapters
architecture. Provides a standardized error taxonomy (`AppError`), a
dedicated type for remote-service failures (`RemoteError`), and the small
amount of glue needed to translate between them and the wire (HTTP/gRPC)
at the application boundary.

> **Design goal**: one in-app error type for application-domain errors,
> a *separate* type for "we called a remote service and it responded with
> failure" — distinguished by type, not by fields inside one shared type.
> Cross-cutting concerns (retry, logging, HTTP mapping) get a stable
> taxonomy to switch on; debugging keeps full access to the original
> protocol-level and remote-app-level signals.

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/ikonglong/go-apperror
```

Requires Go 1.22+.

## At a glance

```go
import "github.com/ikonglong/go-apperror"

// Construct via per-Code factories. No generic apperror.New(...) by design —
// every AppError must carry a Code from the standardized taxonomy.
err := apperror.NewNotFound("user not found",
    apperror.WithCase(apperror.NewStrCase("user_id_missing")),
    apperror.WithEvent("user.lookup"),
)

err.Code()    // CodeNotFound  (canonical)
err.Case()    // user_id_missing
err.Event()   // user.lookup
err.Message() // user not found
```

Calling a remote service and translating its failure into your taxonomy:

```go
// In a driven adapter, after receiving a 503 from user-service:
return &apperror.RemoteError{
    Canonical:   apperror.NewUnavailable("user-service degraded"),
    Service:     "user-service",
    Operation:   "GetUser",
    Response:    &apperror.Response{StatusCode: 503, Body: rawBody},
    BodyCode:    "DEGRADED",
    BodyMessage: "service in maintenance",
    RetryAfter:  30 * time.Second,
}
```

`RemoteError` is **not** a subtype of `AppError`. `Canonical` is a parallel
normalized view — access it directly via `r.Canonical.Code()`. See
[ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md](./ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md) for the full rationale.

## Core concepts

| Concept | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `Code` | What category of failure, from a closed standardized taxonomy (NotFound, Unavailable, IllegalInput, ...). Use for cross-cutting decisions. |
| `Case` | (optional) The specific business condition that produced the failure (`"purchase_limit_exceeded"`, `"insufficient_inventory"`). Orthogonal to Code. |
| `Event` | The operation/event during which the failure occurred (`"user.signup"`). For structured-log aggregation. Format: `{namespace}.{operation}`. |
| `Cause` | Underlying error for `errors.Is` / `errors.As` chains. |

For `RemoteError`, three layers of "code" coexist:

```go
r.Canonical.Code()   // canonical: our taxonomy (CodeUnavailable)
r.StatusCode()       // protocol: HTTP/RPC status (503)
r.BodyCode           // remote app: parsed from Response.Body ("DEGRADED")
```

Each layer answers a different question; log all three for full
observability fidelity.

## Code reference

The Code constants form a closed, standardized taxonomy. Construct an
AppError carrying a Code via the corresponding factory (e.g.
`NewNotFound("...")`). Descriptions and the ambiguous-case rules below
are adapted from
[gRPC's status codes](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md),
with names and notes adjusted for the HTTP-oriented use case.

Table entries omit the `Code` prefix for readability — the actual Go
identifiers are `CodeOK`, `CodeNotFound`, etc.

| Code | Num | HTTP | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OK` | 0 | 200 | Not an error. Exists only for the Code↔HTTP mapping; no factory provided. |
| `OpCancelled` | 1 | 499 | Operation was cancelled, typically by the caller (context cancelled, client disconnected). |
| `UnknownError` | 2 | 500 | Unknown error; classification information is missing or the failure came from an unknown error space. |
| `IllegalInput` | 3 | 400 | Client supplied illegal input (malformed field, missing required value). |
| `Timeout` | 4 | 504 | Deadline expired before the operation could complete. For state-changing ops, may be returned even when the op later succeeds. |
| `NotFound` | 5 | 404 | A requested entity was not found. |
| `AlreadyExists` | 6 | 409 | The entity the client attempted to create already exists. |
| `PermissionDenied` | 7 | 403 | Caller is identified but lacks permission for this operation. |
| `TooManyRequests` | 8 | 429 | A resource has been exhausted: per-user quota, rate limit, per-resource budget. gRPC equivalent: `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`. |
| `FailedPrecondition` | 9 | 400 | System is not in the state required for the operation (e.g. non-empty `rmdir`). |
| `OpConflict` | 10 | 409 | Concurrent operations conflicted (optimistic-locking version mismatch, transaction abort). gRPC equivalent: `ABORTED`. |
| `OutOfRange` | 11 | 400 | Operation attempted past a valid range (e.g. read past end of stream). |
| `Unimplemented` | 12 | 501 | Operation is defined but not implemented in this service/version. |
| `InternalError` | 13 | 500 | An invariant expected by the underlying system has been broken. Reserved for serious internal errors. |
| `Unavailable` | 14 | 503 | Service is currently unavailable; typically transient — retry with backoff is reasonable (not always safe for non-idempotent ops). |
| `IllegalState` | 15 | 500 | Illegal/corrupt data in our datastore, unrecoverable data loss. Roughly gRPC's `DATA_LOSS`, slightly broader. |
| `Unauthenticated` | 16 | 401 | Request lacks valid authentication credentials for the operation. |
| `IllegalArg` | 29 | 500 | Illegal arguments passed *within our own code's layers* — a programmer-error contract violation. |
| `AuthorizationExpired` | 30 | 401 | Credentials were valid but the session/token has expired; re-authentication is needed. |

### Choosing between similar codes

Several codes overlap in scope. The rules below resolve the ambiguity —
most of these are adapted from gRPC's guidance because the same questions
arise in any RPC-shaped system.

**`CodeFailedPrecondition` vs `CodeOpConflict` vs `CodeUnavailable`** —
all three reject an operation; what differs is *what the client should
do next*:

- `CodeUnavailable` — retry the same call later, with backoff.
- `CodeOpConflict` — retry at a higher level (e.g. restart the
  read-modify-write sequence when a test-and-set fails).
- `CodeFailedPrecondition` — do NOT retry until the system state has
  been externally fixed (e.g. an `rmdir` against a non-empty directory
  won't succeed until the contents are removed).

**`CodeIllegalInput` vs `CodeIllegalArg`** — both mean "wrong input",
distinguished by *who* supplied it:

- `CodeIllegalInput` (HTTP 400) — bad input from a *client* across an
  interface boundary; the client should fix and resubmit.
- `CodeIllegalArg` (HTTP 500) — bad args passed *within our own code* —
  a contract violation between internal layers. It's a bug.

**`CodeIllegalInput` vs `CodeOutOfRange`** — both HTTP 400:

- `CodeIllegalInput` — the input is problematic regardless of system
  state (malformed identifier, missing field).
- `CodeOutOfRange` — the problem may resolve as system state changes
  (e.g., reading past end-of-file). Prefer it when callers may iterate,
  because it makes "end of iteration" easy to detect programmatically.

**`CodeNotFound` vs `CodePermissionDenied`** — both restrict access:

- `CodeNotFound` — hide existence from an *entire class* of users
  (gradual rollout, undocumented allowlist).
- `CodePermissionDenied` — deny access for specific users within a
  class who would otherwise see the resource exists.

**`CodeUnauthenticated` vs `CodeAuthorizationExpired`** — both HTTP 401:

- `CodeUnauthenticated` — no credentials, or credentials are
  fundamentally invalid (wrong signature, unknown subject).
- `CodeAuthorizationExpired` — credentials *were* valid; the session
  has expired and re-authentication is needed.

## How it fits the architecture

This library is designed to pair with the ports-and-adapters style
described in [architecture.md](./architecture.md). Per-layer responsibility:

| Layer | Error responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Domain** | Constructs `AppError` for domain failures (NotFound, FailedPrecondition, OutOfRange, IllegalState). Knows nothing about HTTP/RPC. |
| **Application** | Propagates errors from below, may add context via `AddErrCtx`, may construct use-case-level `AppError` (e.g. AlreadyExists for a duplicate signup). |
| **Driven adapter** | Owns translation of remote-service errors. Constructs `RemoteError` when the server responded; constructs `AppError` (typically `NewUnavailable`/`NewTimeout`) when no response was received. |
| **Interfaces** | Catches errors at the wire boundary, maps `Code` → HTTP status via `apperror.HTTPStatusFor`, sanitizes outgoing payload. |

The full rules (when to use what, anti-patterns, code recipes per layer)
are in [ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md](./ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md). That document
is also designed to be referenced from a downstream app's `CLAUDE.md` so
Claude Code follows the same conventions.
